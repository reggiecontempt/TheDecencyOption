I assure this is an accurate representation of myself and this work.  I beg you to engage.  Thank you so much for everything!  I respect your work, and I guarantee you I will not try to give you undue deference.  

Sir, the following is my original work, guided by nothing but trying to logic out the past to forgive it.  Please read to the bottom if it is worth your time,  I really appreciate it. I am really just try to get your attention. See below for what I am trying to get to you by being so wrong you have to engage.  Respectfully.  

I am working on something that could be big, and it's no secret.  https://github.com/reggiecontempt/TheDecencyOption
I am trying to do something that could be important, and your work has been a huge inspiration for it.  I need your help, or at least I need help, with the next steps, which are expert review.  Please help or refer help if you can.  I hate doing it this way, and selecting you for involvement like this.  I need to do this right.  Thank you soo much for being here in this message


"The Ancient Hebrews sensed that nature was ordered and pure, so it was their station to understand that order and purity, and how it applied to them, because humanity were the only violators of this perceived order, in their observation because we were the only ones with the capacity to violate that purity and order, they were tasked with understanding and enforcing it within themselves, and that they were the first ones to understand this and therefore sanctified as anointed.  They causally linked human contamination of the natural order a purity to the literal cursing of the ground that represented their prosperity.  

That was the onus. To enforce their segment of the natural order and purity so they could sustain as a people in harmony with nature and its consequences.  They believed, as the human interface with God on all of earth (in their scale of Earth), their inequity was punished because THEY were THE interface, and God would not tolerate their failures.  This was their burden, and theirs alone.  They were motivated by continuing tribal success to capture their Promised Land, God rewarded their faith and diligence with the promise of a literal Promised Land that would be larger, more fertile, easier to defend, etc.  If the Land is at stake, give them good Land.  

The problem is that they never wrote THAT part down, just the ad-hoc legislation to define especially pervasive and egregious sins against the natural order and purity.  Without the scaffolding, it looks like it looks now.  

Every single law with consequence is either about maintaining the natural order or enforcing purity.  To these ends. 

The 10 Commandments add some intuitive things, like don't be violently antisocial, entitled, or rude. God chose us for this, so recognize his position and make regular time for him.  And the rest is about preserving their model of natural harmony. Peace between God and the ground through his chosen interface. They notice the rules by how God punishes them, and enforce the associations that reenforces their existing understanding, all well intentioned and to be in that role.  

Much, much later, the Roman Emperor noticed the potential of this work and its update back.  He saw it as a unifying force to reunite his fracturing kingdom.  He gave the initial clergy way more authority than was good for anyone.  They ran with it.  

A modern literal interpretation produces what it was designed to produce by the people who, deliberate or not, inject every effort with their cultural and dogmatic biases, amplifying and decontextualizing the material that supported what they needed from the text with minimal negotiation. These dogma depended on rigidity to authority, and so it was hardened into word-for-word rods of reproof. 

It only doesn't make sense if you don't think about it. So we have been kept far from thinking.  
Don't come at me with complete works, either.  The Rosetta Stone really fucked you guys up from the happy little Vulgate, and THAT's a SCHOLARLY (fuckin' academics, right?) translation of at least some of the original Hebrew; a library that is lost to time, so you do not get to say you know better through your hundred-generation amplified and distorted dogma.  The Rosetta Stone would not have been a disruption if the text were incorruptible.  They found an early save point for material you were relying on being lost.  So there was a catastrophic renegotiation between the Vulgate which was in human possession for hundreds of years, arrogantly calling it the single packet of God's whole-grain truth, until the Rosetta Stone, and then the Dead Sea Scrolls.  None of this should have added or changed anything in a protected word.  

So you using ancient, contextless text that was once authoritative for a genuine cultural mandate to an anointed people to be responsible for maintaining God's interface with the GROUND, and that they would be rewarded for their fidelity in this matter, and punished for fucking up God's clean, orderly place to interface with his creation; to oppress and control people in your own culture 5000 years later is you being a fucking bully who thinks ancient stories and logicless dictate are the supreme authority on earth.  

It is not your fault you believe what you do so dearly.  But it is someone's.

I am reaching out like this because I don't how else to.  I you and Esoterica are the only honest biblical scholars I've run across.  I so deeply admire your intuitive separation of text and dogma.  It is inspiring.  

I am reaching out because I am reaching completion for the code, and I do not have a base.  I am literally one guy who was so devastated over the summer that he did this, because that is the provable truth.  I can also send you my ChatGPT archive without reserve so you can check everything that built this.  I decided to speak my mind my way, and that included protecting my message for as long as it holds interest:

I am building an indestructible, ethical, volunteer-installed mesh network platform with tiny, run-on-anything, rebuildable-by-script node package that syncs to serve a single document with aggressive resilience and a lineage that can be proven to be CONSTRUCTED with nothing but protected speech that is directed at the survival of humanity as its greatest mandate, and that survival necessitates flourishing, so the only path to our primary purpose is to maximize flourishing.  

my git is https://github.com/reggiecontempt/TheDecencyOption
I will include the unencrypted database of my library of work anywhere you ask me to put it. 
Reggie Contempt is my sense of humor for the person this is coming from.  

I beg you to build the package and look around.  it is a web interface with a few backend services to serve and access its primary served document.  This works for any database, right now, but is certainly not limited. Users may also ingest their own texts and chat with them through AI that knows its role.  Any ebook. it is deliberately omnilingual and meet the user where they are.  it can run off of anything, on anything.  It is first a subversive assertion to the permeance of information by aggressively assuring it as long as there is interest.  

I have parked DontTrustMe.org. I will send a sample of my own writing related to the project.  I don't think I am being wild when I say that this could be huge. A honeypot for reactionaries to rage at it because it is critical of them and they cannot kill it because it had them in mind as the problem.  

You have my implicit trust and my complete respect.  I would love to work together if it works, and I would love a shove in the direction if not.  You are my first, obvious choice if it is going to be a Communicator.  Deeply, thank you
