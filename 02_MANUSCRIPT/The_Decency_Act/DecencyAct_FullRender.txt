A BILL
To establish standards of Human Decency and civic accountability for all persons and institutions exercising authority.

(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act is to establish enforceable standards of Human Decency within all governmental, corporate, and institutional bodies exercising authority.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
As used in this Act—
    (1) “Person” means any individual possessing self-awareness and moral agency;
    (2) “Authority” means any position empowered to direct, compel, or limit the actions of others;
    (3) “Indecency” means any conduct by an Authority that intentionally or negligently diminishes Human Flourishing or conceals the truth from those affected; and
    (4) “Civic Trust” means the total moral and material confidence placed in institutions by the public they serve.

SEC. 101. PURPOSE.
Dignity is a non‑negotiable civic right and the foundation of Decency.

SEC. 102. RIGHTS ENUMERATED.
The rights of dignity include bodily autonomy, truthful governance, and access to sustenance and education.

SEC. 103. ENFORCEMENT.
All public authorities bear the duty to protect dignity. Violations constitute high indecency.

Education serves Human Flourishing rather than economic yield.

SEC. 202. UNIVERSAL ACCESS.
Access through adulthood is guaranteed without regard to wealth, creed, or lineage.

SEC. 203. CURRICULUM INTEGRITY.
Instruction must advance reason, ethics, science, and civic decency; indoctrination or monetized distortion is prohibited.

TITLE III—GOVERNANCE
SEC. 301. PURPOSE.
Governance is stewardship, not dominion; authority exists at the pleasure of the People.

SEC. 303. ACCOUNTABILITY.
Decisions, expenditures, and communications must be published to the Civic Ledger.

No servant may hold a stake in outcomes they regulate.

Institutions above a defined threshold maintain open, real‑time accounting.

TITLE VII—CIVIC TRUST AND PUBLIC FLOURISHING
SEC. 701. PURPOSE.
Civic Trust is the foundation of authority; where trust fails, authority dissolves.
